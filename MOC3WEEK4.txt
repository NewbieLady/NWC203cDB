Fair queueing attempts to provide equal-size buffers to flows
Head-of-Line queueing
In the leaky bucket, the packet output rate can be variable
76.8 Mbps
Token bucket size is zero 
All of the above
Drop strategy
Improves performance of cooperating TCP sources
Packets produced by TCP will reduce input rate in response to network congestion
Buffer length
Link utilization
A time-out due to missing acknowledgement
